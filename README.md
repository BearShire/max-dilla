# max-dilla
Project max-dilla is my first project in c++ and in programming as well. It's based on old polish kind-of-economic
game (2000 y.) with this same title, which was base on the dope game. The first line of code was created in 3th September.
I know it is poor written, when I will implement all main functions, the code will be re-written, and re-factorised.

The save.tt file stands for profile saving, and the ceny.txt file contains prices of the drugs, in the final version they 
will be generated from pseudo-random numbers with periodic fluctuations to make cash on them.
