# max-dilla - simple text economic game
Project max-dilla is my first project in c++ and in programming as well. It's based on old polish kind-of-economic
game (2000) with this same title, which was base on the dope game. The first line of code was created in 3th September.
I know it is poor written, when I will implement all main functions, the code will be rewritten, and refactorised.

The save.tt file stands for profile saving, and the ceny.txt file contains prices of the drugs, in the final version they 
will be generated from pseudo-random numbers with periodic fluctuations to make cash on them.

For now, game is in polish language only.
